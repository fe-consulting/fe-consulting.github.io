As I said, I’m a huge fan too. </p>\n<p>Despite the controversial <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Javascript Fatigue</a>, it’s undeniable that the newest tooling available brings awesome features and functionalities that we love. </p>\n<p>Yes, frameworks provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tooling for reusing code like never before</li>\n<li>better testing options</li>\n<li>a vast amount of third-party libraries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But… it’s important to remember that <strong>frameworks provide only a part</strong> of the many lines of code that make up a project.</p>\n<p>I have seen React projects coded way worse than some using jQuery. Or Angular 1.x projects written way better than others using the latest Angular.</p>\n<p>Why? </p>\n<p>That’s probably because the developers who wrote the project were just not as good at architecting and designing large, complex codebases. </p>\n<p>They weren’t using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>design patterns</li>\n<li>tests, of any sort</li>\n<li>code reviews</li>\n<li>… just basic software engineering practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That, <strong>frameworks cannot teach you</strong>. They help a lot, they provide guidance, and examples, but only so much. Large-scale projects need more thinking than that — and it’s not an easy task.</p>\n<p>Some of us think that by just using the latest piece of tech, we are spared from thinking, and architecting, and designing every keystroke. But, as it turns out, that’s wrong.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-things-that-really-matter\"><a href=\"#what-are-the-things-that-really-matter\" aria-label=\"what are the things that really matter permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What are the things that really matter?</h3>\n<p>I am not ashamed to say that I would not pick up an old project nowadays if I wasn’t sure that a plan was in place to move forward with newer technologies.</p>\n<p>But other than the stack used at a company, I nowadays have a larger set of questions for prospective employees or people I meet networking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>do you write tests? unit, functional, end-to-end tests? how important is that to you?</li>\n<li>what design patterns do you use?
