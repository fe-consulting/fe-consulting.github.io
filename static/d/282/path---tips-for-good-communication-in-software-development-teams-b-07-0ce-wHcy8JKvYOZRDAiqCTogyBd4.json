In my experience, a healthy workplace is also usually <strong>an efficient one</strong>.</p>\n<p>The most difficult situations I’ve come to having to deal with in my career are definitely reviews on <em>pull requests</em>, which especially for junior developers, can be a very intimidating experience.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is a particular scenario that is quite evident even in some large and famous open source communities, which causes many coders to keep away from contributing to Open Source.</p>\n<h4 id=\"why-do-we-pr-review\"><a href=\"#why-do-we-pr-review\" aria-label=\"why do we pr review permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why do we PR review?</h4>\n<p>The common reasons why we use reviews in the first place is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>catch bugs before they get shipped to the master branch</li>\n<li>propose improvements and discuss changes</li>\n<li>learn code you haven’t written and keep up-to-date with the codebase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my career, though, I’ve definitely met some developers who totally missed the meaning and objective of reviewing other developer’s code, although they were a small minority.</p>\n<p>Most of the people I worked with totally knew the concept of reviewing, but <strong>the way they did it was completely wrong</strong>. And guess what? <strong>I was totally wrong too</strong>.</p>\n<p>In my career, I have made an enormous amount of mistakes, which only with years of experience I’ve come to realize and comprehend.

If you can relate, review your attitude.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>**Acknowledge others<br>\n**Not saying you should compliment people on a daily basis, but remember to praise them when you think they did good work, or for example when you notice an improvement in their skills. People love compliments, and they’re free.</li>\n<li><strong>Is the code you write yours?</strong><br>\nProbably not. Don’t get attached to your code, and try and remove the feeling from your head that it is <strong>yours</strong> (unless you’re also the owner of the company, of course)</li>\n<li><strong>Sometimes win, sometimes lose</strong><br>\nStop wanting to seem and be right all the time. Coders love being the correct ones and will argue to prove they are for hours. Leaving a discussion without seeming right is, sometimes, the best thing to do</li>\n<li>**You are not the code you write<br>\n**Your code is not who you are, nor does it represent your intelligence nor your value as a human being. Sometime your colleague’s comments will be harsh. Sometime they will be right, and sometimes they will be wrong, but don’t let that affect you on a personal level</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stop wanting to seem and be right all the time</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"solve-conflicts-as-a-team\"><a href=\"#solve-conflicts-as-a-team\" aria-label=\"solve conflicts as a team permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Solve conflicts as a Team</h4>\n<p>If you are in conflict with a coworker, the obvious strategy is to talk it out and solve it between the two of you.

This is the sort of situation when the whole team should be involved in the decision, democratically.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make your team aware of the conflict</li>\n<li>talk it out, take a decision everyone is comfortable with</li>\n<li>make the solution a standard going forward</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"make-it-easy-to-review-your-code\"><a href=\"#make-it-easy-to-review-your-code\" aria-label=\"make it easy to review your code permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Make it easy to review your code</h4>\n<p>Now, let’s see how communication could be handled better by the author’s point of view. Here is a list of tips for helping reviewers, especially the grumpy ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Small is better</strong><br>\nKeep pull requests <strong>as small as possible</strong> and push often. I don’t like to give exact or absolute numbers, as it’s a tough one. If you’re writing code such as HTML, the size of the diff will be much bigger than Javascript or CSS code. Just keep it a reasonable size.</li>\n<li><strong>It’s best to review early than later</strong><br>\nLet reviews come from the beginning! If a reviewer will leave 30 comments in one go, it’s going to be a lot more difficult and discouraging to discuss changes and fix them. If you let reviewers review smaller pieces of code, you may be sure that it’s going to be a lot simpler to solve these issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation<br>\n**Provide documentation</strong> and *<em>comment on your own PRs\\</em>* to explain parts that might seem quirky so that you anticipate what the reviewer may comment on. Add TODOs, and delegate larger chunks of refactoring to different tickets, so that the reviewers are better aware of certain limitations and your overall thoughts.</li>\n<li>**Ask for Help<br>\nIf you are in doubt, *<em>ask for help\\</em>* or for opinions before you submit a pull request. However busy they may be, most folks do love helping</li>\n<li><strong>Review your own code</strong>\nRead and review your diffs before you commit and if your company has a conventions document in place, *<em>make sure you follow it</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"final-words\"><a href=\"#final-words\" aria-label=\"final words permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Final Words</h3>\n<p>Most of the difficult programmers I have worked with were not ill-intentioned. They were extremely passionate for their job, and this is likely the number one reason why we often fall into conflicts while doing what we love.</p>\n<p>It’s undeniable that the tech-scene suffers from toxicity and many people contribute to it in different ways. Tweets, public forums, GitHub reviews, etc. I see this daily. But programmers are not inherently bad human beings, for the most part. We are a quite particular class of the workforce: we just really care.</p>\n<p>Of course, this set of tips will not prevent a team from having conflicting views: <strong>conflicts are part of the job and will always exist</strong>, but with effective communication, we all have the possibility to reduce them to a minimum, or better, to handle them better and work in an efficient, peaceful and healthy place.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, being compassionate helps teams perform better, learn better together, deliver great products and generally helps enjoy a better day to day work experience.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed the article and leave a message if you agree, disagree, or if you would do anything differently!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>If you enjoyed this article, follow me on</em> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@.gc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>Medium</em></a> <em>or</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>Twitter</em></a> <em>for more articles about Angular, RxJS, Typescript and more!</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tips for Good Communication in Software Development Teams","date":"06.06.2019","category":"software-engineering","featuredImage":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cyq39_Fi_qPwiAJqgeCsCg.jpeg"},"timeToRead":9}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/tips-for-good-communication-in-software-development-teams","prev":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/abstracting-state-with-ngrx-facades"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Abstracting State with NGRX Facades","category":"angular"}}}}
